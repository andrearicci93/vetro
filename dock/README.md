# Vetro launcher

A glass launcher for a rooted Samsung Tizen TV, written in C# against the TV's own EFL
libraries and run with the TV's `dotnet`. Vetro starts and stops it from its **Launcher**
tab; it is off until you turn it on.

When it is on, the Home key opens this launcher instead of Samsung's Home. The dock shows
the same apps, in the same order and with the same icons as Samsung's Home row, read
from the TV at start-up, and ends with two outline pills, Settings and Samsung Home.

## Layout

- `src/` the dock. `Core/` is pure logic (layout, catalog, input decoding) and has tests;
  `Native/` holds the P/Invoke surface; `Ui/` draws with EFL.
- `tests/` desktop tests of `Core/`: `cd tests && dotnet run`.
- `res/` the images (bar, shadow, glow, focus ring) and the generic Settings/HDMI icons.
- `tools/` generators for those images (`make-glass.cjs`, `system_icons.py`).
- `designer/` a standalone page to try looks; `designer/chosen.json` is the design the launcher currently draws.

## The look

The look is one design, ported from the designer page's JSON. `src/Core/Design.cs` holds the visual values and
`src/Core/Layout.cs` the geometry; both generators read those two files, so the pictures cannot disagree with the
code. `app/tests/dock-design.test.cjs` checks them against `designer/chosen.json` value by value.

One rule ties the shapes together: an icon's corner radius is a percentage of its side (`Design.IconRadiusPct`),
and the focus ring and the glow are built from that same radius, at every size the icon takes while it grows.

To change the look: edit `chosen.json` (or paste a new designer export there), update the matching constants in
`Design.cs` / `Layout.cs`, then run `node tools/make-glass.cjs` and `python3 tools/system_icons.py`-based
`render_all` before building (`cd tools && python3 -c "import system_icons as s; s.render_all('../res/icons')"`).

Not ported from the designer (the launcher cannot do them): blurred background behind the bar, label fonts, the
brightness boost on a selected pill, and the desaturation of unselected icons. With the chosen design there are no
name labels and no clock, so the label styling options are not carried either.

## Build

```sh
dotnet build -c Release Launcher.csproj   # targets netcoreapp3.1, the runtime on the TV
```

Vetro's package build copies the result into `app/native/dock/`.
